# Technical Brief: Financial Bill Tracker

## Project Overview
A single-user financial bill tracker built with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Material UI. The application will have two main screens: a bill entry interface and a data visualization dashboard with charts and graphs. Data will be stored locally in JSON format.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material UI (MUI)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Data Storage**: JSON files (stored locally)
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts or Chart.js
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in build system

## Application Structure

### Pages
1. **Bill Entry Page** (`/pages/index.tsx`)
   - Form to add new bills
   - Table to display existing bills
   - CRUD operations for bill management

2. **Analytics Dashboard** (`/pages/analytics.tsx`)
   - Monthly spending charts
   - Category-based expense breakdown
   - Trend analysis over time

### Core Components
- `BillForm`: For adding/editing bills
- `BillTable`: To display and manage bills
- `Navigation`: For switching between pages
- `Charts`: Various chart components for the analytics page

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Bill {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  amount: number;
  date: string;
  category: string;
  isPaid: boolean;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### Data Storage
- Bills will be stored in a JSON file in the project
- Next.js API routes will handle reading/writing to this file

## Getting Started

Here are the commands to start your project:

```bash
# Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript
npx create-next-app@latest bill-tracker --typescript

# Navigate to the project directory
cd bill-tracker

# Install Material UI and related dependencies
npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

# Install a charting library
npm install recharts

# Install UUID for generating unique IDs
npm install uuid
npm install --save-dev @types/uuid

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps After Setup

1. Create the basic page structure for bill entry and analytics
2. Set up the data context for state management
3. Implement the bill entry form and table
4. Create API routes for data persistence
5. Develop the visualization components for the analytics page

Would you like me to provide any specific component code to help you get started with the implementation?
