# Active Context: Financial Bill Tracker

## Current Focus
The project is in the development phase. We're addressing TypeScript compatibility issues and implementing visualization components.

## Recent Changes
- Created the project structure based on Next.js
- Defined the technical requirements and stack in the tech-brief.md
- Established the memory bank documentation system
- Implemented visualization components using Nivo charts
- Fixed TypeScript errors in components
- Addressed MUI v7 Grid compatibility issues

## Current Technical Issues
1. **MUI v7 Grid Component Breaking Changes**: 
   - The Grid component in MUI v7 has significant API changes compared to previous MUI versions
   - The `item` property is no longer supported directly in Grid component props
   - Using both `container` and `item` together causes TypeScript errors
   - This particularly affected form layouts (e.g., in BillForm.tsx) with nested Grid components

2. **TypeScript Compatibility Issues**:
   - Event handling between different input types required type guards
   - Fixed issues with the `checked` property on non-checkbox inputs
   - Form component events (TextField vs Select vs Checkbox) have different type signatures

## Solutions Implemented
- **For MUI Grid Issues**: Replaced Grid components with Box components using flexbox
   ```tsx
   // Instead of:
   <Grid container spacing={2}>
     <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>
       {/* content */}
     </Grid>
   </Grid>

   // Use:
   <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: 2 }}>
     <Box sx={{ flex: { xs: '0 0 100%', sm: '0 0 calc(50% - 8px)' } }}>
       {/* content */}
     </Box>
   </Box>
   ```

- **For TypeScript Event Handling**: 
   - Used type guards to safely handle different input types
   - Created separate handler functions for different component types
   - Applied proper type assertions when accessing properties like `checked`

## Next Steps
1. **Deployment Refinement**
   - Fix GitHub Actions deployment workflow issues
   - Ensure static data works properly in deployed environment

2. **Documentation**
   - Complete user documentation
   - Ensure all code is properly commented

3. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive testing for all components
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility
