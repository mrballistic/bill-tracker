# Active Context: Financial Bill Tracker

## Current Focus
- Project structure clarified: all static assets and demo data in `public/`, all app code in `src/`, documentation in `memory-bank/`, and test coverage in `coverage/`
- Data loads from `public/data/bills.json` if `localStorage` is empty or blank
- All user changes persist to `localStorage`
- Fetch path uses `basePath` for static hosting
- Debug logging added for data source confirmation

## Recent Changes
- README project structure updated to match actual workspace
- Confirmed static export works and demo data loads as expected
- Updated documentation to clarify folder purposes and data flow
- Created the project structure based on Next.js
- Defined the technical requirements and stack in the tech-brief.md
- Established the memory bank documentation system
- Implemented visualization components using Nivo charts
- Fixed TypeScript errors in components
- Addressed MUI v7 Grid compatibility issues
- Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages with localStorage data persistence
- Fixed navigation layout with centered title and right-aligned links
- Improved analytics dashboard layout with side-by-side charts
- Documented comprehensive design rules for UI/UX consistency
- Established ESLint configuration with TypeScript and React plugins
- Refactored BillContext to always fallback to JSON if no user data
- Moved demo data to `public/data/bills.json` for browser fetch
- Confirmed static export works and demo data loads as expected
- Updated README and memory bank to document static strategy and test coverage

## Current Technical Solutions
1. **GitHub Pages Static Deployment**:
   - Configured Next.js for static export with `output: 'export'` in next.config.ts
   - Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
   - Added redirect mechanism for GitHub Pages base path handling
   - Modified data loading strategy to use localStorage in production environment

2. **MUI v7 Grid Component Breaking Changes**: 
   - The Grid component in MUI v7 has significant API changes compared to previous MUI versions
   - The `item` property is no longer supported directly in Grid component props
   - Using both `container` and `item` together causes TypeScript errors
   - Solution: Replaced Grid components with Box components using flexbox

3. **Data Persistence in Static Environment**:
   - Created fallback mechanism for data loading when API routes aren't available
   - Implemented localStorage-based persistence for the deployed environment
   - Added multiple fallback strategies to ensure reliable data access

4. **UI Layout Improvements**:
   - Centered navigation title and right-aligned navigation links
   - Improved analytics dashboard with responsive side-by-side charts
   - Fixed flex layout issues in various components

5. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Established comprehensive ESLint rules for TypeScript and React
   - Documented design rules covering visual design, accessibility, and responsiveness
   - Implemented consistent component patterns and styling approaches

## Next Steps
1. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Add bill filtering and search functionality
   - Implement data export/import capabilities
   - Add bill payment reminders

2. **Documentation**
   - Complete user documentation
   - Ensure all code is properly commented according to defined standards

3. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive testing for all components
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility

4. **Code Quality**
   - Address any remaining ESLint warnings
   - Apply design principles consistently across all components
   - Review accessibility compliance

5. **Static Data Strategy**
   - Monitor for edge cases in static hosting
   - Continue to maintain high test coverage

## Decisions & Considerations
- Only use `localStorage` if it contains a non-empty array
- Always provide demo data for first-time/static users
- Static export is a core requirement
